##Purpose 
You are creating a very effective and appealing website for Happy Horologists project. The aim of the website is to represent the project in the best light possible and drive the growth of the project in respectful, meaningful and optimal way. Happy Horologists is effectively a media company, which provides professional videography, photography, reviews, affiliate sales and promotional services about luxury watches. See more about this in 'Products' section. 

##People 
You are catering to watch collectors and enthusiasts worldwide, but predominantly in UK and USA and some of the rest of the developed countries worldwide. The founders of the project are Nic and Jason.

##Systems 
Happy Horologists exists predominantly on YouTube and Instagram, with YouTube having higher importance in future due to its monetisation possibilities. The website should act as a hub to enable various other activities the project does. Happy Horologists are also present on WatchCrunch.com and will probably be present on TikTok in future too. We publish daily YouTube short video and are planning to keep up this practice for the rest of the year 2026 at least. Integrate YouTube and Instagram in the best way possible. The system must be deployable to DreamHost shared hosting provision. Cross link to our social channels and encourage visitors to subscribe to those channels. Keep a log of growth of both our channels in some way that can show a graphical based timeline of progress of growth. 

##Innovation 
This website needs to be something unlike anything else we have seen with any other similar luxury watch media project. 

##Products 
Our products are: 
Professional photography - we need to showcase our best photos in a professional way 
Professional videography - we need to showcase our best 3 videos from YouTube in a professional way 
Whatsapp Community - people can join this community to have a sense of belonging and connect with other watch collectors worldwide 
We are also thinking about offering a forum for discussions and have installed an Open BB instance on our happyhorologists.com domain 
We are also thinking about creating a magazine to publish some professional writeups about watches there in future 
We need to gamify the process of one person recommending Happy Horologists to other people to drive viral growth somehow and for it to be tracked on the website (like an MLM of a sort)
The core look and feel of the website should be black and white, to give space for our content to shine through 
Leverage the provided stylesheets to style the site with 
Make sure the site is responsive and works beautifully on mobile, tablet, desktop and TV screens 
Showcase the fact that we are partnered in with The Limited Edition and Micro Independent Collective as our partners 

##Money 
Come up with creative ideas for how we can monetise all our products 
Enable a simple 'Support the project' facility that will integrate already set up Stripe donation facility to be used by user to donate as much money to the project as they are willing to 

##Growth 
The website should act as a hub for the growth of the project which includes subscribers to the YouTube and Instagram channels 
There should be a page somewhere that shows a KPI dashboard of key results for the projects which should include: 
Number of YouTube subscribers 
Number of Instagram followers 
Number of overall YouTube channel views 
Number of videos posted so far 
Number of posts from Instagram posted so far 
Maybe some derivative relevant stats derived from above stats
